I am a project manager and operations administrator working at the intersections of access, research, and education for the humanities. Wearing many hats, I have worked in museum curatorial, teaching, provenance research, grantmaking, archaeological fieldwork, and digital humanities. 
<br>
<br>
Until June 2025, I was a Senior Program Officer at the National Endowment for the Humanities, Division of Preservation and Access, where I shepherded over $15 million in taxpayer dollars directly back to the American public through a fiscally responsible lens, including the funding of digitization, preservation, and sustainability projects for humanities institutions, including museums, libraries, archives, universities, and tribal communities. My position, along with two-thirds of those at NEH, was abolished in June 2025.
